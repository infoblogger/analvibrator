<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span>The anus is one of the most erogenous zones</span></strong><span>&nbsp;for both women and men.&nbsp;Reach&nbsp;</span><strong><span>extreme pleasure</span></strong><span>&nbsp;together with your partner or alone, can be complemented with sex toys, among which are the so-called "anal vibrators."&nbsp;What are they?&nbsp;How are they used?&nbsp;Surely you have come here with thousands of doubts, but rest assured that all of them will be answered here.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Before going shopping for your first anal vibrator, it is very important to know it thoroughly, its concept and very specific characteristics, which undoubtedly make it a toy worthy of a place in your room.&nbsp;Pay close attention to this shopping guide that we have prepared for you.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span>What is an anal vibrator?</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span>An&nbsp;</span><strong><span>anal vibrator</span></strong><span>&nbsp;is nothing more than a sexual toy or accessory specifically designed to be inserted into the anus, in such a way that it does not cause damage or that the user has to "force" it.&nbsp;As an extra point, in addition to its design, it contains an internal vibration module to stimulate the area much more.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span>The differences between a common vibrator (for the anus and vagina) and one that is designed for the anus are quite specific.&nbsp;In fact, you can see them with the naked eye, and it doesn't require much expertise or knowledge of sex toys.&nbsp;Here we are going to name a couple of them, so that you can better decide on acquiring your first anal vibrator.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span>First of all,&nbsp;</span><strong><span>its shape</span></strong><span>&nbsp;, this is a thin point and near the grip area (where it is held) it tends to be thicker.&nbsp;This thickness can reach up to 4 centimeters and its length can be up to 20 centimeters.&nbsp;Additionally, its tip is oval in the vast majority of cases to facilitate its use in the anus.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span>What materials can it be made of and what size does it usually have?</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Anal vibrators are very&nbsp;</span><strong><span>varied</span></strong><span>&nbsp;in terms of the materials used in their manufacture.&nbsp;The user can choose between hardness or softness, this being quite subjective and to his liking.&nbsp;There are&nbsp;</span><strong><span>latex, plastic, glass or metal</span></strong><span>&nbsp;(the latter is a material not recommended for beginners).&nbsp;Remember, in any case, a good lubricant should always be used.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span>As mentioned before, its size can vary with a thickness of&nbsp;</span><strong><span>up to 4 centimeters</span></strong><span>&nbsp;, but there are thinner models for inexperienced users.&nbsp;As the main function of the anal vibrator is to dilate the anus little by little, there are models with lower thicknesses, with mostly rounded tips.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span>What types are there?</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span>There are various models, simple and somewhat more "complex" for those who want to go further and&nbsp;</span><strong><span>achieve the orgasm of their dreams</span></strong><span>&nbsp;.&nbsp;For girls, there are options with a double tip, to stimulate the clitoris at the same time or do double penetration (vaginal and anal).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span>There are also products with very specific functions for each type of user.&nbsp;For guys, the main idea is prostate stimulation, so the thin, smooth tip is paramount.&nbsp;Every user when starting out (without much experience) should choose an anal vibrator made of soft materials.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span>You can choose between those with a smooth surface</span></strong><span>&nbsp;(without any kind of protuberance) or those with the opposite, a much more rustic surface.&nbsp;Pleasure is subjective in this regard, as not everyone gets used to the pain of anal stimulation.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span>How much does it cost approximately?</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span>The price in Spain for an anal vibrator is varied, and depends on a series of factors that start from its construction material, to the functions that it includes.&nbsp;</span><strong><span>You can find them from 16 euros.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Other models with a greater number of functions such as a remote control or a moving head (which stimulates the anus much more) reach prices of&nbsp;</span><strong><span>up to 45 euros.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span>It is well known, then, that the price range is quite adapted to the needs you have and there will be no problem finding the one that best suits you or your partner, from an economic point of view.</span></p>
